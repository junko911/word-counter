# Word Counter

## Requirements

This project requires NodeJS and npm/yarn installed in your environment.

## Installation

Start with cloning this repo on your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:junko911/word-counter.git
$ cd word-counter
```

### Server
To install and set up, run:

```bash
$ cd api
$ npm install
```

Or if you prefer using yarn:

```bash
$ cd api
$ yarn install
```

### Client
For the client, run:
```bash
$ cd ../client
$ npm install
```

Or:

```bash
$ cd ../client
$ yarn install
```

## Usage

To use the project, first run:

```bash
$ cd ../api
$ npm start
```

Or:

```bash
$ cd ../api
$ yarn start
```
The server should start running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Now, on another tab, you need to run the client:
```bash
$ cd ../client
$ npm start
```
Or:
```bash
$ cd ../client
$ yarn start
```

Make sure you run the server first and then the client so the client will run on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/).

The project should now be running on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/).
